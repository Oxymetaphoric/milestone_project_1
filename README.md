## :star: Project Goals :star:

This is my milestone one project for the
[Code Institute's](http://www.codeinstitute.net) _'Level 5 Diploma in Web
Application Development'_. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to utilise HTML
and CSS, including CSS frameworks, to create a small, responsive, well-designed
and well-implemented website for a business, fictional or otherwise. For this
assignment I have chosen to create the webpage for my mother-in-law's dog
breeding business, 'Jenamins'. The objective is to create a website that could,
potentially, operate as a replacement for the business' current site (link
available on request).
