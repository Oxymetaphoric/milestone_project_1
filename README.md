# Milestone Project One

## Project Goals

This is my my milestone one project for the
[Code Institute's](http://www.codeinstitute.net) _'Level 5 Diploma in Web
Application Development'_. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to utilise HTML
and CSS, including CSS frameworks, to create a small, responsive, well-designed
and well-implemented website for a business, fictional or otherwise. For this
assignment I have chose to create the webpage for my mother-in-law's dog
breeding business, 'Jenamins'. The objective is to create a website that
could,potentially, operate as a replacement for the current site (link available
on request).

### User Goals

- Easy navigation, plenty of breadcrumbs, back to the top links and other
  quality of life features
- Accessible for colourblind, visually impared, and other users with
  accessibility needs
- Easy to find contact and location information
- Lots of pictures of cute puppies
- Gain insight into the running of the business, levels of professionalism,
  approachability and other factors relating to the decision to buy a puppy

### Site Operator Goals

- Connect with potential dog owners looking to purchase a puppy
- promote the business more broadly
- A place to direct people looking for information
- provide a way of potential customers to register their interest
- Show the customer what makes this company special
- Promote the family run, but professional, nature of the business
- provide customers with information on current litters
