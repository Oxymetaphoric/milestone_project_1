This is my milestone one project for the
[Code Institute's](http://www.codeinstitute.net) _'Level 5 Diploma in Web
Application Development'_. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to utilise HTML
and CSS, including CSS frameworks, to create a small, responsive, well-designed
and well-implemented website for a business, fictional or otherwise. For this
assignment I have chosen to create the webpage for my mother-in-law's dog
breeding business, 'Jenamins'. The objective is to create a website that could,
potentially, operate as a replacement for the business' current site (link
available on request).

### :smile: User Goals:

- Easy navigation, plenty of breadcrumbs, back to the top links and other
  quality of life features
- Accessible for colourblind, visually impared, and other users with
  accessibility needs
- Easy to find contact and location information
- Lots of pictures of cute puppies
- Gain insight into the running of the business, levels of professionalism,
  approachability and other factors relating to the decision to buy a puppy

### :dog: Site Operator Goals:

- Connect with more potential dog owners looking to purchase a puppy
- Promote the business more broadly
- A place to direct people looking for information
- Provide a way of potential customers to register their interest
- Show the customer what makes this company special
- Promote the family run and professional nature of the business
- Provide customers with information on currently available puppies and upcoming
  litters

### :computer: Developer Goals:

- Develop a site that satisfies the distinction requirements of the Code
  Institute
- Use plain HTML, CSS and frameworks such as Bootstap to create a technically
  interesting and aestetically appealing site
- Use frameworks where necessary so as to not reinvent the wheel
- A responsive website that looks appealing on a variety of screensizes and
  devices
- A performant and efficient site, measured used tools such as lighthouse, that
  is viewable on all modern browsers and devices
