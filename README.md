## :star: Project Goals :star:

This is my milestone one project for the
[Code Institute's](http://www.codeinstitute.net) _'Level 5 Diploma in Web
Application Development'_. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to utilise HTML
and CSS, including CSS frameworks, to create a small, responsive, well-designed
and well-implemented website for a business, fictional or otherwise. For this
assignment I have chosen to create the webpage for my mother-in-law's dog
breeding business, 'Jenamins'. The objective is to create a website that could,
potentially, operate as a replacement for the business' current site (link
available on request).

### :smile: User Goals:

- Easy to find contact and location information
- Lots of pictures of cute puppies
- Gain insight into the running of the business, levels of professionalism,
  approachability and other factors relating to the decision to buy a puppy

### :dog: Site Operator Goals:

- Connect with more potential dog owners looking to purchase a puppy
- Promote the business more broadly
- A place to direct people looking for information
- Provide a way of potential customers to register their interest
- Show the customer what makes this company special
- Promote the family run and professional nature of the business
- Provide customers with information on currently available puppies and upcoming
  litters

### :computer: Developer Goals:

- Develop a site that satisfies the distinction requirements of the Code
  Institute
- Develop a site that satisfies the Goals of the Users and Operator as
  determined by the User Stories and Goals
- Use plain HTML, CSS and frameworks such as Bootstap to create a technically
  interesting and aestetically appealing site
- Use frameworks where necessary so as to not reinvent the wheel
- Create a responsive website that looks appealing on a variety of screensizes
  and devices
- Build a performant and efficient site, benchmarked used tools such as
  lighthouse, that is viewable on all modern browsers and devices

# :bricks: Structure :bricks:

---

The site needs to be structured in an intuitive and straight-forward way with
minimal ability in accessing the web required to succesfully navigate.
Constantly visible, consistent navigation links, links back to the top of the
page for long pages and other quality of life navigation featiures are
essential. Site will be using a tree-style Information Architecture with links
back and forward available to the user at all times via the floating nav element
and/or the footer.

Links and navigation should be clear and unambiguous, interactive to highlight
them visually and well-labelled to help with accessibility.

The website should consist of the following pages:

- Landing page - with a large hero image, some introductory content, nav bar and
  footer with social links and contact details. The nav bar and footer elements
  will be consistent and accessible across all pages of the site.

- Meet The Family! - A page detailing the staff and dogs involved

- About Us - A page detailing the story of the company and the owners, why and
  how it was started, credentials and other pertinent information

- Upcoming Litters - A page to announce the latest news and for returning
  vistors to get updates

- Contact Us - A page dedicated to contact and location information

- Gallery - Just a buncha cute pups!

- 404 Page not found - for mistypes/broken links

- Privacy policy - link in footer and on contact page
